<p>Another screeching noise erupts from opening the door. This time you have an ally. But as you can see on the preview, you are far apart. Between you are 6 allied enemies. <strong><span style="color: #ffff00;">Sultan</span></strong> and <strong>Sheriff</strong> are lurking right in front of your castle. On the opposite side of the river are <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nizar</span> </strong>and <strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">Richard</span> </strong>shooting away at your ally <strong><span style="color: #339966;">Phillip</span></strong>. On the top of the mountains to the left and to the right are the <strong><span style="color: #00ffff;">Abbot</span> </strong>and the <strong><span style="color: #800080;">Snake</span></strong>. Can you save your ally from certain defeat?<br />Try to survive and complete the objective to to leave this land together alive.<br />Also I have a few hints:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
This sounds silly, but basically survive. Enemies will eventually decrease in strength after depleting their initial gold.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
If you want to hold a valuable spot, just fortify it with a tower.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Phillip will withstand a lot of attacks from the start, but as soon as Abbot attacks, he will fall. You have the opportunity to stay lower on the leaderboard than him and send him goods, so abbot attacks you instead of him!</details><details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Completing your castle with moat or wall will keep you safe but also block your workers from accessing the outside area when your gates are under siege.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
Don't split your troops to both sides and focus on one enemy at a time.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 6</summary>
It might feel like cheating, but you can easily deal with Sultan and Sheriff by just shooting at their keeps and bleed them out one after the other with forward towering them down.</details>
<p>Have fun and good luck.<br />by Krarilotus</p>
