<p>On <strong>Father Christmas day</strong>, you are moving on with our journey of day one. If you don&rsquo;t mind, let me introduce the scenario, no worries it wont take long before you can jump into the match, if you haven&rsquo;t done that already...</p>
<p>The ingame description will continuate the story of the first map. You traveled along the river and face the Rat. <strong>You ran right into his trap</strong>, setup to block the valley. You must break through to claim the abandoned village in the left bottom corner. Not only that, but besides the Rat there is a Pig, in light blue, setup in the top left corner, who will soon be ready to assault you with his fast men. They both are commanded by the Wolf, who is building a huge fortress in the top right, reaching over the canyon. You should expect severe attacks incoming from his side. On that note: Nobody will trade you any weapons...</p>
<p>The area in the left bottom corner has some trees spread around a few fertile spots of land. You also can gather resources from various spots at each side next to the mountains. <strong>It might look rough at the beginning. But with some creative thinking, you will get through just fine!</strong></p>
<p>This time around, i collected a few more hints as the map takes longer to complete. I hope you are having fun figuring most of these out yourself, before consulting them in cases of severe struggle. Here they are:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The closer your stockpile is to the resources you gather, the easier it is to protect them as well.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Think twice before killing the rat, it will loose your access to the resources on the lower bottom hill.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
To get control of the gate with your assassins, you need to rally them up before the gate closes. Then take out as many Spearmen as you can with your ranged units prior to their arrival.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Far away from any city, you can not buy or sell weapons. To make Crossbowmen, you should get one dairy farm and produce leather armour rather sooner than later.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
Producing bread from bought wheat is a viable option to boost your early economy. Meanwhile keeping your peasants pleased with ale will give you a huge taxation boost. Another option is to get a huge population and tax it as much as you can, but that takes a lot of skill and control.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 6</summary>
If you left Ratty alive, a tower on the little hill with the farmland and some crossbowmen should work fine to secure that area for yourself. If you have even more control over the Rats castle, you can mine his resources too.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 7</summary>
The Wolf does not rebuild his outer turrets nor his big gate near the river. You can use that to your advantage and claim the area at some point.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 8</summary>
When you don&rsquo;t have trebuchets, catapults can do just as well if used from the right angle.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 9</summary>
Horse archers in large numbers work well to clear enemy towers, but take care as there might be pitch traps layed out across tight spaces.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 10</summary>
Wolf will attack with a huge army and raid with a lot of knights. I want to suggest two solutions for defense. Either enclose your keep early, with a small castle, or build an outer wall from the left mountains to the right mountains. 2-3 square towers with ballistae and a bunch of crossbowmen should be enough to defend his attacks.</details>
<p>Some more hints in details follow, maybe helpful, maybe not:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint Detail 1</summary>
You can use assassins to climb Wolfs gates and put your own crossbowman and archers on his towers. There are many possibilities on how to storm his castle, so let your creativity thrive!</details><details>
<summary>Hint &nbsp;Detail 2</summary>
If you manage to not kill Ratty's lord while shutting down his production on your first attack, you will be granted with an easier start by all the extra resources available to you.</details><details>
<summary>Hint Detail 3</summary>
You can avoid the need of constantly buying wood if you grow your own little forest in your backyard.</details><details>
<summary>Hint Detail 4</summary>
You have only a few farming spots, which are quite lucrative. Supposedly one Dairy farm is necessary. For the rest, wheat is the most valuable resource to farm, while you can buy hops cheap.</details><details>
<summary>Hint Detail 5</summary>
Make sure to never run out of wheat, hops and wood. If you keep your economy running, you will swim in gold before wolf attacks the first time.</details><details>
<summary>Hint Detail 6</summary>
When Wolf has 600 troops, he is attacking soon for the first time! You should better be ready!</details><details>
<summary>Hint Detail 7</summary>
Don&rsquo;t forget to tax your population from the start. With one Inn per 30 population you will have the maximum popularity bonus of +8 from ale.</details>
