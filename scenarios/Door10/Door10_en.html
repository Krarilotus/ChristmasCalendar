<p>As the map behind the tenth door is a smaller one, it is also the first map that was created of all of the calendar maps. It is the first map, that makes you deal with massive technology constraints. The Rat, your partner, has the same limits in his technology as you.<br />You are facing Richard, who&rsquo;s huge castle is towering over the landscape in the top right. He has a nearly unlimited amount of income, judging by the amount of resource buildings in the back of his castle. Most of the farmland is around your ally. Besides that, you have claimed some stone to the bottom right and you got a nice forest in the backyard to supply wood for your weapons production.</p>
<p>You might find yourself in trouble at one point or the other. If you can not beat the map and you already tried everything, consider reading these hints:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
As long as the Rat is alive, you&rsquo;ll have an easy time because Richard will primarily focus on him.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Investing some of your starting resources directly into weapons to defend the Rat can help you out a lot.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
You might want to position your granary closer to the farms, using their seasonal harvesting to your advantage with repositioning some of them.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Taxing with extra or double rations is a good way to fix your gold income, if you don&rsquo;t want to sell half your weapons that you produce.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
Attacking up the hill gives you a big disadvantage. Make sure you&rsquo;ll have enough archers to make up for your disadvantage. You can then fully surround his castle!</details>
<p>Have fun and good luck. I hope it&rsquo;s not too simple for being the 10th map already!<br />by Krarilotus</p>
