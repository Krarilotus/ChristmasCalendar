<p>Yesterday you solved a deep and though through mission. Today you will have a lot of fun experimenting around. Oh no! Your market is gone. <br />That will be a problem...</p>
<p>Because of the ongoing war, <strong>the market had to be shut down</strong>. I have scouted the perimiter and can now clearly tell: you are surrounded! The European lords are in a war with the Arabian lords. The <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Frederick</span> </strong>and the purple <strong><span style="color: #800080;">Sheriff</span> </strong>in the top left corner look like they will havily invest into infrastructure. Once they are set up, they'll become monsterous.<br />Their ally <strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">Richard</span> </strong>is split off to the bottom right. <strong><span style="color: #339966;">Emir </span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: #ffff00;">Caliph</span> </strong>in the top right corner are close to completing their castles. Their ally <strong>Nizar</strong> is also split off, trying to survive desperately in the left bottom.<br />Think positive: You got a lot of starting resources at your disposal and you are situated well on the high ground there.</p>
<p>Have fun and good luck :D</p>
<p>Ah wait, you expected me to post tips, didn&rsquo;t you?<br />Hmmmmm, here you go. Feel free to ignore them if you are familiar with no-market-games:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Richard and Nizar will hunt you down, they always attack their closest enemy. Get rid of at least one ofthem as soon as possible.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Frederick and Emir always go for the one with the most gold. Spending gold is easy, gaining gold not so much.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Sheriff and Caliph always go for their weakest enemy. So don't fall to the lowest on the leaderboard!</details><details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Mangonels from up hill will give you big advantage against close by opponents. Use them wisely!</details><details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
Nizar&rsquo;s castle burns very well, so setting up some fire ballistae will work wonders.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 6</summary>
You could kill Richard or Nizar fast, but you should have enough on your little hill on the bottom already. Keeping them alive might give you other benefits as well, as enemies would target them instead of you!</details><details>
<summary>Hint 7</summary>
Try to manage to keep one batch of trees alive to not run out of wood that you can't buy! You can also delete Killing pits that you don't need to get some fast wood!</details><details>
<summary>Hint 8</summary>
If both teams have members alive, they will most likely harass each other, leaving you free to recruit and expand.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 9</summary>
Make sure buildings you set up are kept safe. Don't waste them by putting them into enemy mangonel range and trebuchet fire. Their wood is worth more than the gold you get through tax! Exception is ofc. the Cathedral, but that is worth even more!</details><details>
<summary>Hint 10</summary>
A bigger storage makes handling resources way easier. try to stockpile those goods that you can't buy but continuously need. You won't get any more pitch and you always need wheat/hops and wood!</details>
