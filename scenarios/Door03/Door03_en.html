<p>You couldn&rsquo;t resist to open the third door. Does that smell like the use of unconventional map<br />design?</p>
<p>You can look closer at the image of the map, by clicking on it. Something prevents you from using your production facilities. Is this a joke? No! You got denied. The only way to regain access is by killing off your enemies one by one. But if you wait for too long, they might overpower your insufficient capabilities to craft an army. Missing weapons are not the only obstacle, you will have no mercenaries and by the way, your engineers got caught and will be unlocked alongside those craftsmen. </p>
<p>I know you always appreciate some help, right? I can give you some advice, as I have oftentimes run into supply issues myself.</p>
<p>One free hint right out of the gate: Saving your game progress regularly will save you time!<br />This obviously applies to any map from here on, as they will only become more challenging in<br />different ways.<br />Your Craftsmen are waiting for you. Have fun and good luck.<br />by Krarilotus</p>
