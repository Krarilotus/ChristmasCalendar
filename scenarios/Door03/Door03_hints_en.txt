Saving your engineers for the important sieges will give certainty for success.
Killing the snake will give you access to crossbows, which will greatly improve your defenses.
Amassing fletchers at the start might be a good idea, although scaling them back will give you a better army composition later on.
When sieging the Wolf, slipping knights by his defenses to destroy his external economy and striking only after he has blown a full army at your walls, might eventually lead to his defeat.
The longer you need to upgrade your technologies, the harder the enemy attacks become.
Monks can be efficient at the start though not very good later on. I suggest unlocking technologies in the following order: Spearmen -> Crossbowmen -> Macemen or Pikemen -> Swordsmen and Knights.
