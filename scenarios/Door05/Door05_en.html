<p>Remember, remember, the 5th of December. A wild Frederick appearing, pigs squeaking and our recruitments stopping. Actually, that is today!</p>
<p>You will have to take on Frederick <strong>without producing any units</strong>. Your starting force is only holding up for the time being and diminished as you read this pamphlet. Looking at your situation it&rsquo;s clear: you are well situated. Only a small effort is necessary to get your economy up and gold printed at the market. But as you can&rsquo;t produce any units, you would have to spend your wealth in a different way. That is where your allies come in. In the top left corner Duc Truffe, in the top right corner on the mountains The Duke of Pigsbury and to your right side &ldquo;The Hog&rdquo; are supporting you and have Frederick surrounded. But they are greedy Pigs, greedy for resources, <strong>your resources.</strong> Can you supply them with the necessities to fight this war on your behalf?</p>
<p>This time for sure you won&rsquo;t need these hints:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Frederick always attacks and raids those that have the most gold. Do you want to take the hit?</details><details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The best way to help your allies is by providing them with their weapons of choice in low quantities. Big chunks of gold will do just fine as well.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Keeping the Pigs fed at all time is good, but you can also coordinate their assaults. Don&rsquo;t forget to cancel an attack command after the attack has finished, else they wont recruit for the next one.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
You can gather your army at your production to keep it safe from mangonels.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
Bread production might be the most efficient to gain a bunch of gold fast early on, but weapons give you way more gold per worker employed. Scaling up production is the key for a constant supporting gold stream to your allies.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 6</summary>
You can use traps to defend your economy from raiders.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 7</summary>
You have some engineers, which might help out a lot to besiege Fredericks castle from your side.</details>
<p>Have fun with your new management position and good luck!<br />by Krarilotus</p>
