<p>Did you peek early? Or is it time to open door 4 already?</p>
<p>In this map you are facing a concurrent thread of <strong>assassins</strong> looming around your territory and climbing your castle walls, while you yourself have to rely on the mercenary troops to defend yourself. It seems pretty straight forward, but how can you deal with those invisible slayers, punching you where you expect them the least? It is still a challenge of strategic thinking after all. What is important? Where to take an advantage and which positions to avoid?</p>
<p>That is exactly, why you should take a look at the preview image above before heading into the chaos. The top left and the bottom right are occupied by silently sneaking Nizars in camouflaging <strong><span style="color: #339966;">green</span></strong> and <strong>black</strong>. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Emir</span></strong>, the other thread, is coming at you with the blue pieces from the top right. The swamp around you will slow down units, which will make your archers miss occasionally.</p>
<p>As this might be your first map to attempt at least twice. I can shorten your time spent, if you are out of ideas with these useful insights:</p>
