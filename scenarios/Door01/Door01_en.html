<p style="text-align: left;">A loud squeaking noise escapes the hinge of this old portal into the world of Crusader&hellip; <em>how long has this been closed?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You are in a medieval fantasy setting, where you&rsquo;ll follow the rules of Stronghold Crusader. We have shot a picture to give an overview of the upcoming mission, look at it above to grasp the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Your Lord starts in the left bottom corner, accompanied by an army</strong>, which was provided to you by your friend <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Emir</span></strong>. <strong>The first thing you will see is your demolished castle</strong> on the right-hand side, surrounded by your enemies: The <strong><span style="color: purple;">Snake</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color: green;">Rat</span></strong> and <span style="color: #00ffff;"><strong>Saladin</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffff00;"><strong>Sultan</strong> </span>is protecting the northern gate of Saladin&rsquo;s castle, while <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sheriff</strong> </span>engrosses the top part of the map, pressuring Emir in an uphill battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the time to <strong>plan your strategy ahead</strong>. Your initial forces include a few engineers to siege an enemy castle, but you will not have access to shields.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As promised, there are some hints with every map. I advise you to only peek, in cases of severe struggle:</p>
<p><strong>Its time to head into battle. Have fun and good luck.</strong></p>
