<p>This map, the map behind this monolithic monstrosity of a gate, Door 8, took me a long time to complete. You march onward with your journey, which has had its last chapter on Father Christmas day. As it turns out, you have not actually killed the Wolf, just one of his commanders. He has sent another <strong><span style="color: #339966;">Rat</span> </strong>to follow your tracks, which has now caught up to you. It is right next to you, blocking half your free passage to the Wazirs. But they are hostile anyways...</p>
<p>The story will be self explanatory once you open up the map. Before that, you should take a look at the preview picture above. You start with your army in the bottom left corner of the map. Some deer are present on the map to hunt for food; other than that, you have some buildings set up at the river in the north. The Rat has built his camp up while you constructed the 3 towers around your base. Now that your backup crossbowmen have arrived, you should start building some more troops and economy and claim this land.</p>
<p>Besides the Rat and you, there are more enemies on the battlefield. In the top left corner, the <strong><span style="color: #800080;">Caliph</span> </strong>has setup his camp. Next to him you see <strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">Wazir &ldquo;The Scourge&rdquo;</span></strong>, towering over the landscape on his mountains of joy. He is known to please his people with goodies, then taxing them to bankruptcy. On the right side you can witness <strong><span style="color: #ffff00;">Wazir &ldquo;The Terrible&rdquo;</span></strong> claiming the mountain of<br />vexation, where he subjugates his people to work, day and night. A <strong>Sultan</strong> has his religious stronghold situated inside the cliffs in the top right corner. To the bottom right a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Phillip </span></strong>is having a good time protecting his little mountain. They all work together in alliance.</p>
<p>As this again is a mission, where <strong>it&rsquo;s all about strategic thinking</strong>, you will have to plan and retry a lot. No doubt, this is the hardest map yet, but as you continue your journey, you can be sure that you will come across even more challenging scenarios. Still, if you don&rsquo;t want to invest into figuring out the right strategy, read some of these tips. But if you like a challenge, try to deal with the map on your own!</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The Rat is a shield, to hide behind. He provides us a field, to grow inside. And when you somehow spare him from an early death, your mind starts, creating new ideas...</details><details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Stone has a high priority. We definitely want to keep always some stone to repair broken staircases.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
You can create secure walkways through using walls as arrow shields covering your peasants.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
A Cathedral will pay for itself with about 42 population in roughly 3 years, just by taxation alone, if you didn&rsquo;t have taxation already available.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
You got one unsafe farm spot next to your quarry. If you don&rsquo;t get the wheat safely, you might be better of with half rations and some ale production.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 6</summary>
Three suggestions to invest into to defend your castle from melee units in terms of gold efficiency: monks, slingers and especially fire throwers.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 7</summary>
You can't sell bread or stone effectively, so figure out other products to sell in large quantity.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 8</summary>
When you take down the Rat, you gain access to a lot of iron. It would be beneficial to have your defenses up in no time and protect it right away.</details>
<p>Ah well, I can see that you might get frustrated over these general gameplay hints for the beginning of the game. That&rsquo;s why I thought ahead and figured out some more clues to precisely point you into the right direction:</p>
<details>
<summary>Hint 9</summary>
It would be such a waste to go and kill the Rat right away.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 10</summary>
Don&rsquo;t put any ranged units up to fight the Rat before you can sustain that critical mass.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 11</summary>
You want to have some archers up, protecting your stone fleet from the Rat&rsquo;s archers, else your stone will never get to your stockpile.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 12</summary>
Set up your stockpile in a way, that you can produce a mass of Crossbows to sell. Having a lot of weapon production running will be your base economy.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 13</summary>
If you run out of food and ale, just buy food and go for half rations. You should have enough gold from buying wood and selling crossbows.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 14</summary>
Don&rsquo;t sell iron directly, you can instead make metal armours, which sell at a higher price.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 15</summary>
You want at least 40-50 stone before you kill the Rat. That way you can build one big square tower and a ballista, to shoot enemy siege engines that will attack you when you lost your shield.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 16</summary>
Put your starting crossbowmen and archers on the little tower near the Quarry to hold that quarry safe.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 17</summary>
Don&rsquo;t forget, you can salvage structures to gain half their building costs back.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 18</summary>
Blocking direct entrance to your castle will make enemy troops walk through the Rat to get to you.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 19</summary>
Try to get ahead of the Rat in terms of Score as soon as possible, else almost all the enemies will prioritize attacking you instead of him.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 20</summary>
When the Rat is dead, you have one spot to put up one more farm, which will get killed from time to time. If you make a dairy farm, each cow will yield you 3 leather armour deliveries.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 21</summary>
Killing Phillip enables you to produce lots of iron to the right and hold it much easier.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 22</summary>
Phillip has a lot of stone behind his hill. If you can secure the bottom side, you won&rsquo;t be depending on the volatile stone from the north anymore.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 23</summary>
Killing Caliph will free up more unit space to besiege the Wazirs castles. Try to move quick to kill enemies as otherwise the troop limit of the map is reached.</details><details>
<summary>Hint 24</summary>
Both Wazirs have huge castles. You could try to burn them down, once they run out of gold to feed their fire department constantly. Figure out which Wazir i easier to starve and strike him first!</details>
